## Setup/Deployment

#### 1. Spotify's API

* Head over to the <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/">Spotify developer portal</a>.
  * Create a Spotify application.
    * In the **App name** & **App description** fields, you may put whatever you want.
    * Agree with Spotify's TOS and click **Create**.
  * Take note of the **Client ID** & **Client Secret**.
  * Click **Edit Settings**.
    * Add `http://localhost/callback/` to **Redirect URIs**.

#### 2. Intermediary Steps

```
https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize?client_id={CLIENT_ID}&response_type=code&scope=user-read-currently-playing,user-read-recently-played&redirect_uri=http://localhost/callback/
```

* Copy and paste the above link into your browser.
  * Replace `{CLIENT_ID}` with the **Client ID** you got from your Spotify application.
  * Vist the URL.
    * Log in if you're not already signed in.
    * Click **Agree**.
* After you get redirected to a blank page, retrieve the URL from your browser's URL bar. It should be in the following format: `http://localhost/callback/?code={CODE}`.
  * Take note of the `{CODE}` portion of the URL.
* Head over to <a href="https://base64.io">base64.io</a>.
  * Create a string in the form of `{CLIENT_ID}:{CLIENT_SECRET}` and encode it to base 64.
  * Take note of the encoded base 64 string.
* If you're on Windows or don't have the `curl` command, head over to <a href="https://httpie.io/cli/run">httpie.io/cli/run</a>.
  * Press enter.
  * Clear the pre-filled command.
* If you're on Linux or Mac with the `curl` command, open up your preferred terminal.
* Run the following command (replace `{BASE_64}` and `{CODE}` with their respective values):

  ```bash
  curl \
    -X POST \
    -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
    -H "Authorization: Basic {BASE_64}" \
    -d "grant_type=authorization_code&redirect_uri=http://localhost/callback/&code={CODE}" \
    https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token
  ```

* If you did everything correctly, you should get a response in the form of a JSON object.
  * Take note of the `refresh_token`'s value.
